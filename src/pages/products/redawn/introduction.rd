# What is Redawn?
!p.lead Redawn is a lightweight markdown alternative, designed to be versatile, approachable, with excellent performance.
@@br
**Redawn** was designed to be like Markdown, but with a simplier syntax and faster. Currently, most features that Markdown supports such as links, images, paragraphs, headings all work, however we introduce new components such as styled text, custom HTML elements & more.


This page was made entirely using Redawn, [check out the source code here](https://github.com/AutomicJS/website)


**Redawn** was coined when trying to re-create markdown in a lighter format, and was being programmed at the crack of dawn. Therefore, Redawn was coined and born.

See the concepts section for full syntax supporting list and examples. :)
